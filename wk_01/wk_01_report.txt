What did I do since the last meeting?
This is week one, so the things that I did was go through and build my git repository and completed the rest of the
assignments.

What am I going to do next?
I am going to make my repository outline appear professional and not just a simple list. 
I am also going to finish all the needed assignments and meet with my team as needed.

What are my blockers?
At this point I really don't know of any blockers. My lack of knowledge on what is to come may be the largest blocker
and a place that I need to study and get a grasp of.
