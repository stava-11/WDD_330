Doing Stuff with Web Things:

This content was not new to me, so the only notes I needed to take were on the local storage. 
I have never used this before and found it interesting that it is available. 

local storage works with a key: value pair which is pretty easy to work with. You just need to set
the item :
     localStorage.setitem(key, value);
then you get the item:
     localStorage.getitem(key);
I read more about this in w3schools, but it was not very informative, except that it stated this is
read only.

My question is:

How do we go about deleting the information saved in local storage?
Also, how safe is it to save items in local storage compared to a session?
