What did I do since the last meeting?
During week two I read all the chapters in Eloquent Javascript because for some reason I was unable to
access the material in the other book. I made sure to go through the code in the topics that was new to me to understand
what was being done in the code and be able to understand it. I also followed up on making the webpage look more professional.

What am I going to do next?
I am going to read through the assigned material and work with the code examples for the sections that I am unfamiliar with.
I am also going to change the home page to look more professional. 

What are my blockers?
At this point I really don't know of any blockers. I look forward to this next week of study.
