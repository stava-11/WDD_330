Week 2
Notes from reading Eloquent Javascript

Ch. 3 - Functions

    When multiple bindings have the same name, code can only see the innermost one.

    Function Declaration
        function getRectArea(width, height)
            return width * height;
        };

    This function can be placed after it is used in the code, the others must come before they are used.

    Function Expression
        const getRectArea = function(width, height) {
            return width * height;
        };
                            
    Arrow Function
        const getRectArea = (width, height) => width * height;
                                
    Closure
        Being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope
                                
    Recursion
        Recursion is allowed in javascript. This means that the function can call itself.
        This is used to help simplify a complex problem.
                        
Chapter 4 - Data Structures
                
    Object.keys will return an array of strings which contains the property names of the object.
                    
    array.shift() will remove the first item in the array.
    array.unshift will add the item(s) to the beginning of the array.
    
    Rest Parameter
        let numbers = [5, 1, 7];
        console.log(max(...numbers));
        // -> 7        

Questions

    What are some great examples of using recursion to break down a complex problem?
