                            Data attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means they’re perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.

                        <li>
                            Names of the data- attribues can be decided by the developer, but must follow the following format
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                            Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging. This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.
